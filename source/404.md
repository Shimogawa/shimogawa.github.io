# 404 Not Found...

But **what the hack is 404**??

Well basically it's just a return code for your browser. Every Http response has a return code that indicates the status of the request. The code is called a **status code**. Here, 404 means that

> The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

Well basically the file you want to retrieve does not exist. So...

<h2 align="center">GO CHECK YOUR URL!</h2>
