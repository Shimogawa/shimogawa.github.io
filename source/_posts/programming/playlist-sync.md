## Project Milestones

> 新坑 | New Project

- [10/18/2020] Suddenly got the mind of doing a playlist synchronizer.
- [10/19/2020] From multiple available languages (Rust, Go, C#, etc.) I finally chose C# to develop. It seems that it's the easiest. However I found out that there is no available documents on the APIs of QQ music. I have to find it myself.
- [10/21/2020] Structures.

## Project Description

A playlist synchronizer to help synchronize playlists of some music players (now planned for QQ Music and NetEase Cloud Music). No plan for foreign apps such as Spotify.
